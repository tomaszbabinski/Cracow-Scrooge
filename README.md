The application was created due to lack of recognition in product prices assisting many people while doing their purchases.
Everyone is a Cracow Scrooge - nobody likes overpayment - sometimes is better to buy something when the price is right!
It will help you collect offers for each products so next time you approach the purchases you can check if the price at the place where you buy if it's a good offer.
Once you add some purchases the app will calculate the average price of a product from all offers and present you how many money you managed to saved.
The chart on the main page inform you about your savings per category.
Right below there is table which shows best offers for each product (showing this information for random products every 15 seconds).
Additionally you may see what's the efficiency of a product like toothpaste - start/stop recording the usage in view for a given product.
The next time you visit the product information it will display the average usage.
This functionality is needed as sometimes it's worth to pay a bit more for a different brand product and enjoy it a bit longer - this is also saving! 

This is how it works:

1) First you need register as a new user.
2) Add purchase groups like groceries, chemistry, electronics, clothes etc.
3) Insert products you want to track by providing them name and brand.
4) Put offers for each product with price and shop name.
5) Finally if you are decided to buy a product - add the purchases.
6) The app will calculate your savings.
7) When you want to see how many days you are using a given product till it's empty/finished just click start/stop buttons.
8) Having that next time the product info will present the average efficiency of a product as of days of usage.
